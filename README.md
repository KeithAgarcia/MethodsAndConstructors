Okay, back to work.

For each of the classes you made yesterday, write getters and setters.

## Requirements

* In each class, write setters and getters for all of its fields.
* In each class, make at least one setter method contain an `if` statement that makes it enforce some kind of constraint.

**HARD MODE**
* Omit the out/ directory from source control.
* For each class, write a constructor that sets all of its field.

**RIDICULOUS MODE**
* In each class, write a constructor that sets all of its fields.
* Come up with at least one readonly static field in one of the classes that you specified
